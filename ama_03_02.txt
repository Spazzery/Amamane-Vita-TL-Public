Thank you for your hard work at practice today. How was it?　How did you feel today?
"Hmmm. Hmm, I think we didn't practice as much as usual. ......
Satsuki covered herself in water, and that made me panic. ......
In addition, after that, Satsuki gave me an oral shove .......
In any case, there are so many events today that it's hard to remember when we were practicing.
But I was able to complete the same menu as usual.
That's true, but ......
In spite of this, I felt less tired than usual.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
"Do you think that hard training is good training?
It's not hard, but if it's effective, it's good practice. I think it's good practice.
"Well, ......, that's true.
It's practice to get better, not practice to push yourself harder.
Maybe the fact that you are less tired is a sign that you are gaining basic strength and muscle power.
Besides, .......
Thanks to Satsuki, I guess .......
"What?　Is it mine?
Yes. When I think that Satsuki is watching me, I feel like I can concentrate more on my practice.
That's why I'm not too tired.
I wonder if that's why I'm not too tired ......." "Ehehe ....... If that's the case, I'm very happy. Thank you very much, sir.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
If you say that, I'll...
Squeak.
Are you okay?　Did you catch a cold from all that water?
No, I'm fine. I was totally fine until just now. ...... Kuchun!
I'm not sure if it got a little chilly. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
I'm really sorry. How can I apologize for ...... working so hard for you?"
"You're worrying too much. You're worrying too much. I'm still pretty strong.
But you know what? ......
"Okay, I get it!　If you're so concerned about me, please give me a gift as an apology.
That will make you feel better, right?
"Yes, ....... Yes, I think I'd feel better if you gave me something to apologize for.
However, I've never had a part-time job while I've been immersed in baseball, and I don't know what I'll do ...... if they ask for something expensive.
I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not going to embarrass you.
"So, senpai. The next time we meet, can you give me one of your worn-out shirts? Can I have it?
What, ......?　A shirt from ......?　What do you use it for?
That's a secret. It's a secret.
Satsuki raises her tail adorably. I'm curious about .......
But there's no reason to say no. ......?
I'm not sure what to do. Then I'll bring it back tomorrow.
I'll bring it tomorrow.　Thank you very much. I can't wait until tomorrow.
I'm hoping tomorrow will come soon too.
Thanks to Satsuki, every day seems to shine brightly, and I can't wait for tomorrow to come so I can practice.
That's right. When I get home, I'm going to drink some protein and do some light muscle training.
"Oh, ......."
What's going on?
I forgot that I have to go shopping tomorrow. I forgot I have to go shopping tomorrow, so I think I'll take the day off from practice.
What are you buying?
Personal stuff. Protein, glove wax, .......
"Hmm, all that baseball stuff. That's what makes you a senior.
Can I go shopping with you?
Yes, but ....... It would be boring if you don't play baseball with me.
"That's not true. Of course it's fun to go with someone who doesn't play baseball.
"Besides, I don't want to go to ...... tomorrow and not see you all day. I'd hate that more.
"But you see, you sneezed just now. Wouldn't it be better if you rested for a day or so?
"Mmm. ....... Please don't be mean to me, senior.
"Hey ....... Please do me a favor. Please take me with you. Right?"
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it'll help.
The balance in my heart tipped at once with such a sad expression.
"Well then, ....... If you say so much, shall we go together?
Yes!　By all means!　Hehe ....... This is a date, isn't it?
Well, it can be. ......?
If you want to call it a date, it's exactly what it is.
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time and money. It's a good idea to have a good idea of where you're going.
I did it. It's my first date with a senior. What time and where do you want to meet?"
"Well, ......, how about 12:00 in front of the station?"
"Okay. I'll make sure I'm not late. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.
It was just a simple shopping trip, but it turned out to be a date with Satsuki.
This may be the first time in my life that I've been to such a glamorous event. I'm so excited, I feel like running out right now.
I can't wait until tomorrow.
I muttered to myself as I watched the beautiful sunset.
