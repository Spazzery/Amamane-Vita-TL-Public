"Hey, Satsuki. You can at least pretend.
No, you can't.
Well, then, how about playing catch?　Didn't you have fun playing catch with me the other day?
No.
Oh, my God. You're getting restless.
I want to make light adjustments today, so practice is over after the stretching. That's what we decided at the beginning, didn't we?
That's true, but, you know, ....... But you know what, ......."
I know it sounds childish, but I can't help but pout my lips.
You can understand how Satsuki feels. It's also the day before the game, so the desire to practice has been on the rise ever since.
I know in my head that I should only make light adjustments today, but my heart can't seem to keep up.
I can't keep up with it. Please don't react like a child who has been left in charge. Your motherly love for your senpai is making my heart ache.
"Of course, I want to fulfill whatever you ask of me. ......
But not just today. You can't do this just for today, because tomorrow is an important game. As your manager, I can't allow you to practice any longer.
"Gnnu ......"
Surprisingly, Satsuki's will seems to be firm and she doesn't shake her head easily.
I'm sure you'll agree that it's a fine manager's spirit that doesn't let personal feelings get in the way, but at this moment, I resent the seriousness of it.
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good thing.
"...... haha ....... I understand, I can't have you practicing on your own where I can't see you.
I'll allow you to practice a little bit more.
Yes!　Thank you, Satsuki!
Wow!　My senior is ......."
Even though she was surprised by my sudden approach, Satsuki accepted my selfishness with a gentle smile.
"Did you want to practice so badly?"
"Of course!　All right, then, let's get started.
"Stop, stop. Stop, sir.
I was about to start running when Satsuki called out to me, but she made sure not to let me pass.
I think that if I leave my senior today alone, she will definitely practice too much.
So, I'll practice with you today.
Um, ...... why?
If I'm practicing with you, you'll worry about me and won't be able to give your all, right?
If I practice with you, you'll worry about me and won't be able to give your all. That's how it works.
"I see. ......"
It's true, whether it's playing catch or toss batting. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.
It's not a shame, because it's fun to be able to communicate with her, and that's what I want.
"Okay, me. I'll go change my clothes so that I can exercise easily. In the meantime, don't practice without permission, okay?
"Yeah. I know."
Satsuki waved her hand lightly and walked towards the changing room.
After I saw her off, I went to keep Satsuki's word. I waited for her alone, in a daze.
"Thank you for waiting. You can now train with your senpai to perfection.
"Oh, oh, ......, yes, ......."
I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to say.
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money. Whenever I become aware of them, my heart beats painfully.
"So, senpai, what should I do?"
Huh?"
No, I was just wondering if you want to practice.
Oh, yeah, that's right!　But what shall we do?
Well, how about a little run?　Just to warm up.
Well, yeah. Let's run!
Yes!　Don't leave me behind, okay?
Don't worry. I'm only going to run lightly. Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.
I felt that if I stayed still, I might say something strange.
As if to hide it, I started running down the track at a light jogging pace.
But it's kind of nice, isn't it? "But it's kind of nice, running shoulder to shoulder with seniors.
"I feel like I'm really coming of age!"
How about you?　Are you having fun?
Oh, it's ...... fun .......
That's right!　It is better to run together than to run alone. You can also chat with them like this.
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
I don't feel tired at this pace, and it's perfect for running while talking.
However, the problem was .......
"Senpai?　What's wrong?"
"What?　What's wrong?
I don't know, I just feel like I'm not concentrating on running. ......
Are you bored with running with me, by any chance? Are you bored running with me?
No, no, no, not at all!
It's more like I concentrate too much on one part of .......
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
I'm not sure what to say.　It's also quite hot today, so you don't need to overdo it.
I'm fine. I just started running.
Also, I've been thinking that I need to ...... lose some weight lately. So I'm going to run as hard as I can.
I don't think there's any need for that.
As I said this, I quickly ran my eyes over her entire body.
I think she has a feminine body. It's not like she's got a lot of meat on her.
A girl always wants to be the best she can be. Especially in front of the one you love."
...... Does that mean you're doing this for me?
Yes, because I want my senpai to think I'm cute all the time.
Also, I want to wear a lot of cute clothes. So I just have to work hard.
I see, Satsuki's proportions were maintained by this high level of consciousness.
All of this was for me. It makes my heart burn to think about it.
"Haa ...... haa ...... haa ......."
"Are you okay?　Satsuki.
Haha, yes ....... Huh. ...... Huh. ......
I'm a little tired ...... but ...... haha, haha ......
"In order for fat to be burned, you need to ...... ...... exercise for 20 minutes.
I'm going to do my best to ...... do my best to ...... do my best to ...... do my best to ...... do my best to ...... do my best to ...... do my best. Phew ...... phew ......."
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.
I glanced at my watch and saw that it had been at least 15 minutes since I started running. That means I have to keep running for at least another five minutes.
"Hang in there, Satsuki. I'll keep running with you."
''Ha, yes .......  I've already given up. ...... But... ......
But, since my senpai is with me, ...... haha, haha ....... I feel like I can do my best ....... Haa, haa ......."
Sweat appears on Satsuki's forehead and her cheeks turn red.
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
（I'm not sure what to say. It's quite sexy,.......)
I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm not sure what to make of it.
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
It's a good idea to take a look at your own personal life.
"Oh, oh, what's wrong?"
Oh, how many minutes is ...... left? ...... Haa, haa, haa ......
It's less than five minutes.
Wow, I get it. ...... Phew ...... phew ...... haa, haa ......."
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.

I'm fine, but why?
I'm fine, but why?" "It's just ...... something. I'm not sure what to say. I'm sure it's not fatigue.
I'm sure it's not because they are tired, but because ...... they are sexy. It's because Satsuki is sexy. ......
（I'm sure it's not because you're tired, but because you're sexy. I'm sure it's not because you're tired. I have to take it seriously too.)
"Look, we're almost at the goal. Let's go for the last one!
"Yes, yes!　Yes, yes! ......, ......, ......, ......, ......, ......, ......, ....... Hmph. ...... hmph. ......
"Haa ......, haa ......, mmm ....... Haa ......, haa ......."
"Oh, and a little more ....... ...... mmm. Hmmm, ......, hmmm, ......."
"Hmmm, ...... hmmm, ...... hah ....... "Hmmm, ...... hmmm, ...... haaa, ...... haaa."
"Go-go-go ......."
Good work, Satsuki. It's a nice fight. If you stop too soon you'll get a stomach ache, so let's cool down a bit.
Haha, yes ....... Haa ...... haa ......."
Whenever Satsuki took a big breath, her breasts would also bounce softly.
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
