"One, two, three, four..."
G-rok, shi, hachi."
I stretch in the empty pool, consciously shouting out loud.
I don't think I need to put that much energy into it, but there's a reason why I have to do it now.
That is....
You are full of energy, aren't you? Senpai."
The mermaid, or rather my girlfriend and manager, Satsuki, showed up from the locker room.
She was wearing a swimsuit that was designated by the school, but it made her look strangely seductive.
But you have to be so energetic. You'll be defeated by this heat, won't you?
Today's temperature is over 35 degrees Celsius, and they're warning about heat stroke.
It's especially hot today. I'm glad the pool is open.
It was fortunate that the swimming club was also on Obon vacation, so we were able to rent the pool for independent practice.
Normally, the advisor would have to be present, but since both Satsuki and I are well-behaved, we were given special permission.
(Well, ....... (Well, that's not the case anymore, since just a few days ago. ....... (Well, ......, though it hasn't been since a few days ago. ......)
But I'm a little confused.
"Yeah, well, what is it?"
() "But you're in a bit of trouble.
You see, the sun is so strong that I'm sure I'll get sunburned soon.
You can't use sunscreen at the school pool. ...... I can't use sunscreen in the school pool. ...... I'm worried about it because I don't have very strong skin. ......
"Yes, that's true. I'm afraid of heat stroke, so you should stay in the shade.
I casually try to move her out of my sight.
If I don't, I won't be able to take my eyes off her, and my heart won't stop pounding.
It's a good idea to stop with the pounding, but if you get an erection, you can't hide it in a swimsuit.
If you say so, you too, senpai. Now, let's go to the shade together.
"Oh, I'm good. We're going to the pool after this.
Heat stroke is not something that can be managed by energy or stamina, you know.　If you underestimate it, you'll get hurt.
"Here, senpai. Let's go to a covered place together. See?"
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
I'm glad to hear that thoughtfulness, but .......
"It's too close, Satsuki."
I'm not sure if that's true.　It's not like this is a normal thing.
You may be right, but ....... I mean, you're dressed differently today than usual. ......
Are you nervous?
Well, yeah. ....... It looks good on you. ......
Do you want to ...... touch it?
Yeah, ...... well, ......."
I'm not sure if it's the midsummer sun that's making my mouth water, but it's making it more honest than usual.
You can touch it if you want.　You can touch me as much as you want, as long as it's for a senior.
"Well, well then, ......."
I'm not sure what to say, but I'm going to say it.
I'm not sure what to do. It's a great way to get a feel for what's going on.
I'm sure you'll agree. I'm ticklish when you touch me like that. Please touch me more firmly.
"Wow, okay."
Following Satsuki's request, I increase the pressure on my palm.
I can feel her body temperature a little higher than usual, and the softness is comfortable. It slowly melts my reason.
I'm not sure what to do. Your hands are big ....... And it's hot.
Satsuki's body is also hot. And it's pounding.
Because ...... senpai is so close to me. ......
It's not only because of the temperature that Satsuki's cheeks are flushed and sweaty.
"Senpai......"
"Satsuki......"
I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think it's a good idea.
The distance between them gradually becomes zero, and then .......
I'm not sure what to say. Senpai ......."
"Satsuki ......."
The exchange of heat for just a moment. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.
"We kissed ......, didn't we?"
That's right ......."
"Senior, were you satisfied with just one kiss?"
I didn't, but ....... But I need to practice. ......
You don't have to push yourself, okay?　Patience is bad for you.
I want to hear your honest feelings.
I'm ....... I'm .......
Yes.
I want to kiss Satsuki more.
Yes. - Senpai ...... mmm ...... mmm.
Satsuki ......
Me and Satsuki kissed over and over again, like little birds pecking at each other.
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
"Nnngh...... nnngh...... nnngh...... nnngh......
I can't stop myself from kissing her. I've kissed you so much that I'm out of breath.
I'm out of breath from all the kissing." "Yeah, ...... phew ......."
The heat and lack of oxygen has left both me and Satsuki exhausted.
I want to make out with her more, but ....... I'm not sure how much more I can take.
I'm sorry to leave you, but ...... we have to start practicing soon.
That's right,....... I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.
You can find a lot of things that you can do to make your life easier.
I'm not sure what to make of this.
So, here's today's exercise. Let's start with some underwater walking training.
"So, senpai, please get into the pool right away. I'll show you how it's done here.
"Thank you, coach. I'm counting on you.
I'm not a coach, I'm a manager. Now, I want you to stand up straight in the pool.
Got it!
I followed Satsuki's instructions and got into the pool to position myself.
I thought it would be easy, just walking in the water, but .......
I didn't expect it to be so tiring,....... I can't believe how tiring it is. ......
After a dozen minutes of practice, my energy level had reached its lowest point and I was lying on the side of the pool in a heap like a beached seal.
Even though I had completely underestimated the load of the water, I hadn't expected it to be this hard. ......
"Are you okay?　Senpai."
"Uh, yeah....... Haa ...... haa .......
You don't look okay at all, do you?
Yeah. ...... haha......
You've been saying "yes" all day.
Yeah. ......
I knew I had to say something, but I couldn't get my thoughts together at all.
I raised my thighs firmly and walked through the water, moving my arms as well.
It was all I could do, and yet I felt more exhausted than I had after a knock from the coach.
Shall we call it a day?　Overwork is bad for you.
No, that's not how ...... it works. I just walked. ......
But still. As your manager, I can't allow you to practice any more.
That's harsh.
I understand that you want to practice a lot, but there is a limit.
If you keep practicing, I'll give you lots of rewards.
"...... Really?"
I couldn't help but bite at the seductive word "reward.
"Yes. I never lie to my seniors.
What kind of reward is it, by the way?
What kind of reward, by the way? - That's a ...... secret.
But I'm sure you'll be pleased with it.
Yeah, ......, .......
When it's a secret, it's human nature to become even more curious.
I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to be able to keep my legs and feet .......
I'm not sure what to do. I'm going to cut off practice here today, as Satsuki said.
Yes!　I think that's a good idea. I'm glad that my senpai is being honest with me.
"Then, come here. Let's take a shower to get rid of the chlorine.
"Let's see, ....... Are you going to take a shower with me, Satsuki?
Yes. Yes, but don't worry. I'm wearing a bathing suit, so I won't be embarrassed.
Is that a problem ......?
That's the problem, you know.
I'm sure it's not.
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
I'm going to go.
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
