Ugh. ...... I'm so nervous. ......"
My mumbling melts into the empty locker room.
It was the day of the Red and White match. The pre-game practice had already started and everyone else in the club was out on the field.
But I still couldn't move from this spot.
My stomach ...... hurts ....... I can't get any strength ......."
It's not like I had a food poisoning, or a fever, or anything like that.
It's not like I had a food poisoning or a fever, but I was suffering from a stomach ache that wouldn't go away even when I went to the bathroom.
I'm sure it's because I'm nervous. I'm sure it's because I'm nervous. ...... Hahaha .......
I'm sure it's because I'm nervous.
I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure if I'll finally be able to stand on the field and retire from the baseball team,.......
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.
"What?　I don't know.
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
I'm not sure what to do. Are you okay now?"
"Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm so glad. It's before the game and I was thinking about what to do if I got in the way, so I ended up at this hour.
The game will start in a little while. You haven't come out to the field yet, have you?
"I've been looking for you for a while now. I've been looking for you for a while now, but I can't find you at all.
The sound of a ball hitting a metal bat and people's cheers could be heard from behind Satsuki, albeit faintly.
It seems that Satsuki is waiting for me on the ground.
Yes. I'm in the locker room. Well, everyone else is practicing. I'm the only one here, though.
"What?　Don't you have to practice?
The usual nervousness is getting to my stomach. ...... I'm not really in a condition to exercise.
At this rate, the red and white games will be ...... It might be a little tough.
No!　Senior, you were practicing so hard. ......
And you were so energetic yesterday, weren't you?
Just by listening to her voice, I could tell that Satsuki's expression was on the verge of tears.
I'm not sure what to do. I desperately squeeze out my voice.
You're right, ....... I thought I could do it yesterday, too. ......"
But it seems ...... to be no good. ......
"Senpai ......."
An awkward silence enveloped us.
I really don't know how this ...... happened. I've only made Satsuki sad ....... What should I do ......?
I'm not sure what to do. I'm going to hang up now, and I'll call you back later.
I'm sure you'll be happy with the results.　I want to talk to you face to face.
I don't mind. ......
Thank you very much. I'll see you later. Senpai."
I did as Satsuki asked and hung up the phone once, then waited for her to call me back.
And then, a little while later, I picked up the phone with a video call, and there it was.
