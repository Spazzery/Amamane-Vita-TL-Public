What?　Is that ......?　The cupboard's locked. ......"
"Oh. Is it a tamper-proof ......?"
I heard that there are some medicines in the infirmary that are dangerous to use without permission.
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for and how to get it.
"Mmmm, ...... even though it's an emergency, ......"
You can find band-aids and antiseptic solutions in the locker, but you can't leave your senior alone. ......
No, no, no, no, I'm fine with this, okay?
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
You can't do that. You have to disinfect it properly. What will you do if it gets infected?
"In this case, go to ....... Excuse me, senpai.
Hmm.
"What ......?"
Before I could stop myself, Satsuki's lips caught my fingertips.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. It's a real stimulus, and it sends shivers up my spine.
"Hey, hey, Satsuki!　You're dirty!
"Mmmmm. Mmm. ......"
Even though I tried to pull my finger out, Satsuki pursed her lips tightly and wouldn't let me go.
In fact, she pressed her tongue firmly against the wound and gently licked the saliva off it.
"Chuchu ....... Please hold still. You're going to open up the wound.
No, that's not the point. No, that's not what I'm talking about.
Then you'll have to disinfect it even better. Mmm. ......
Oh, hey, ......."
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
I'm not sure what to say, but I'll try. I'm not sure what to say. The blood has stopped, hasn't it?
"Oh, ....... So it's time to ...... go, right?
Yes, it is. Mmm. .......
Huh. ....... Well, . That's a good disinfectant.
Oh, yeah. ....... Yes, that's right ......."
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I think Satsuki's cheeks are getting redder and her fingertips are getting stickier. ......
It's ...... so unrealistic that my head is going to start spinning.
I'm going to put a bandage on the end of it. Please give me your fingertips."
Yeah, ......."
As Satsuki told me, I left my fingertips in her hands and let her take care of them carefully.
I looked at her with a bit of a dumbfounded expression on my face, not really feeling the actuality of the scene being taken care of like that.
