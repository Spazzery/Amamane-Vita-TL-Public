"Then, senpai, let's have a chat together. I want to get to know you better and better."
It's fine, but won't ...... distract me?
"Not at all. I'm sure you'll enjoy cooking.
"Cooking is all about feelings. If I'm happy, the food will taste better.
So, chatting with me is a great way to help.
"Well, if you insist, ......."
In fact, I would like to help you with something, like chopping vegetables or washing dishes. The kitchen itself is not that big to begin with.
It's a good idea to keep it to just talking, as Satsuki suggested, rather than forcing your hand.
But when it comes to talking, it's hard to decide what to talk about.
"Anything is fine, anything at all. I want to know a lot about you. I want to know so much about you.
"What you like, what you don't like. Memories, things you can't forget.
I think it would be great if we could share those things and build up ....... I think.
I wonder if I'm coming off as a heavy woman for saying these things.
No, I think you said a very good thing.
My friendship with Satsuki is growing steadily, but it's still early days for us to have known each other.
Even though we see each other almost every day, our main activity is baseball practice. I'd like to see more of a different side of her.
Satsuki is really thoughtful, isn't she? I'm sure she'll make a great wife.
"Oh, shit. ......?
S-senpai-senpai!　Is that a marriage proposal?
Uh, yeah, ......."
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
It's hard to deny that the intentions weren't that deep, but it's hard to deny when you're expecting something like this,.......
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. I had no choice but to be honest about it.
I'm sorry to get your hopes up, but I wasn't thinking that far ahead. ......
But.... I'm sorry to get your hopes up, but I wasn't thinking that far ahead. I've thought about it, but it's still a long way off. ......
I'll tell you when the time comes. But for now, it's ......."
"Mmm-hmm. ......."
What?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You look so cute and desperate. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
I was really expecting to get angry, but when I saw Satsuki's smile, I couldn't help but be taken aback.
You don't have to be so upset. I didn't think it was a serious proposal from the start.
But it would be nice if he did. But I was hoping it was. That's why I said what I did.
"I didn't mean to surprise you. I'm sorry for saying such a strange thing."
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry for saying such a strange thing." Satsuki sticks out her tongue a little in a mischievous manner to scare you.
It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.
I'm sure you're not the only one. It's true, isn't it?
Yes, it's true. I'm not sure I'll ever find a girl as bubbly and cute as Satsuki. I don't think I'll be able to find a girl as bubbly and cute as Satsuki in the future.
In fact, I'm more worried that she'll lose interest in me.
"That's absolutely not possible. I love you even more than you think I do.
Besides, you're also very kind, and your hard-working nature is cool. ......
"That's why I don't think I'll ever meet a better man than you."
I don't think that's too much of a compliment. ...... But thank you. I'm glad to hear it."
I think that's too much of a compliment.
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.
"Well then, senpai. Why don't we do a rehearsal of our future together?
"Let's pretend that we're really married and loving newlyweds and have a conversation.
Oh, come on, that would be very embarrassing, wouldn't it?
Don't worry. We're the only ones here.
I also like to see your embarrassed expression. I want you to get used to me more.
"So, in preparation for that day. So I'm practicing so that I can talk to you properly. That's what I meant. What do you think?
"Yeah, ....... ......."
I try to think a little about the future, which I had only dimly imagined until now.
I'll always have Satsuki next to me, and we'll talk about trivial things. That seems like a very happy thing.
"That's right. Let's give it a try. Its ...... for the future."
"Yes!　I'm so happy. Thank you very much for listening to my selfishness.
This is not selfishness. I mean, you've always listened to my selfishness. ......
What? You're the one who never says anything selfish, aren't you? You're the one who never says anything selfish, even though I want you to say more things. ......
Yeah, I'm telling you.
"I'm not saying that."
"Pfft. ...... pfft. ......
"Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, ......"
We say the same thing to each other and both of us start laughing.
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your vacation.
"...... hey ...... you ......"
"Whoa!　I'm not sure what to say.　Geez!
Are you okay, senior?
No, I'm fine. ...... I was so surprised, I just gulped. ......
That was ....... You didn't mishear ......, did you?　Satsuki, now .......
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I got a little carried away with ....... I said something strange, didn't I?
No, not at all. No, not at all. I was just taken by surprise. There's nothing to apologize for.
"Well, then, ....... You didn't mind?
No. It made me happy. ......
"Then ....... Can I call you again?
Yeah, sure.
....... You.
"Oh, oh, ....... It's ....... It's .......
Even though it was only three letters, I felt as if my heart had been grabbed.
It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?　Your face is all red.
"No, I'm not used to being called that. ......"
You don't mind, do you?
No. I'm very nervous.
Hmm. You're so shy. You're very shy, aren't you?
If you want, I'll start calling you "you" instead of "senior".
That's ......."
I think for a moment at the tempting suggestion. Both senior and you are difficult to discard.
But then again, .......
I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm more used to that.
But you're right, ....... You can call me you while I'm cooking, right?
You look great in an apron, like a real wife. ......
I love you. I understand, I love you. I love you.
I'm not sure what to do with it.
I'm not sure what to do with it. Today it's gingerbread pork.
Pork is good for recovering from fatigue, so it's perfect before a game.
Add a salad and miso soup. It's perfectly balanced.
Oh, ...... this is amazing ......"
A variety of colorful dishes lined up on the dining table.
The food not only looks great, but it smells great too, and it makes me hungry.
We have plenty of second helpings, so don't hesitate to eat.
"Oh, but... But don't eat too much, it's bad for you. Make sure you eat about eight portions.
Understood. Okay, let's eat!
I clasped my hands together and extended my chopsticks to the ginger-yaki.
I put my hands together and reached for the gingerbread first. The well-cooked pork was soaked in the sauce and came apart easily with my chopsticks.
"Amu...... mogumogu......."
How is it ......?　Is it good?"
I give a thumbs up to Satsuki's question.
It's soft, well seasoned, and tastes so good you won't be able to stop eating it.
I'm glad you liked it. I'm glad it suits your taste buds.
The meat won't escape. Please eat slowly."
As I was busy shoveling in the gingerbread, I shook my head, squirming my mouth.
The rice counteracts the sweet and sour taste. And a salad in between.
My taste buds were in a blissful state, thanks to this exquisite triangle.
"Hmmm. That's a lot of food. It's worth it for me to cook for you if you eat so well.
I'm going to go make some more rice. Please wait a moment.
Satsuki stands up with the just emptied bowl.
How much do you want to eat?
How much would you like to eat? Thank you.
Yes, I understand.
Satsuki smiled and headed straight for the kitchen.
And so, I enjoyed a dinner that filled my stomach and my heart to the brim.
